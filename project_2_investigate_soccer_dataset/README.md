# investigate-soccer-dataset
This project was done as part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree by Udacity.
## Project Overview
  In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings
  
- [The European dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) was used in performing this analysis
 
## Analysis Process
**Must have**

* <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a>
* <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>
* <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>
* sqlite3 (comes installed with python)

If you do not have any of these, you can start by downloading <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/installing-anaconda-windows">anaconda</a> and then run the following on anaconda prompt 

* `pip install pandas`
* `pip install numpy`
* `pip install matplotlib`

- connect to the sqlite database using `sqlite3.connect`('***filename***')
- **Alternatively you can access database files using soware like [DB Browser.](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)**
>Assessing data
Build intuition on the data by running codes like `df.info`, `df.shape`, `df.duplicates`, `df.isnull`
